##  Automatic billing trolley

This is a quite simple project which aims on reducing the time a customer has to wait to get his billing done by automatically computing the bill amount. The project consists of an 8051 microcontroller, an RFID reader and an LCD display all integrated on a PCB. Later, this PCB can be attached to a trolley. Every customer is given a mastercard when they enter the shop for the first time which consists of an unique RFID tag. Also, all the shop items are attached with unique RFID tags and all of them are pre-configured in the database.

So, the customer after entering the shop, must show his/her mastercard in front of the RFID reader present on a trolley to configure himself/herself. Later, he/she can add items by showing the RFID tags and the bill is simultaneously calculated and displayed on the LCD screen. If a user feels that he/she has taken some unnecessary items, he can place it back by again showing the item in front of the reader. To check the total bill at any time, he can press a check button to see the bill on display. Finally, when he/she feels that all the required items are present, he/she can swipe the mastercard to confirm the purchase and finalise the bill. 

In this way, the time of billing and the manpower required for it (manually reading the tags and entering the info in computers which is done by the cashiers) are reduced making the customer's experience a pleasure buying from the shop.
