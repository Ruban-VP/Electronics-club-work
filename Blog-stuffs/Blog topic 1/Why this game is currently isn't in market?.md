# Why this game is currently isn't in the market?

We all know videogames were there when the old CRT (Cathode ray tube) TV was used. But now people shifted to LCD and LED TVs. The problem with these TVs are that they have a delay of nearly 70 milliseconds or 4.2 frames (60FPS TVs). So even if the user aims correctly, the transition won't be captured because of the delay. The old CRt TV doesn't have this problem and hence the game was suitable to be played at that times. But now it is not possible because of this delay problem. But if you still have a CRT TV...

Happy hunting!!!
